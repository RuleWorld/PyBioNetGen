added basic .scan file plotting to the plot subcommand

## 0.2.3
BNG2.pl stdout now pipes correctly to actual stdout and can be adjusted via configuraion files

## 0.2.4
Adding documentation, rewriting temporary folder and file handling to use TemporaryDirectory and Temporary file respectively so that these work correctly on Windows. 

## 0.2.5
Fixing a bug that was caused by method renaming

## 0.2.6
Notebook subcommand now by default doesn't open the notebook using nbopen, an argument allows you
to do so.

## 0.2.7
Reorganization of library functionality and library side now has access to configuration parsing from cement framework. Published on PyPI

## 0.2.9
Updating BioNetGen version to 2.6.0

## 0.3.0
Massive model object restructuring complete and XML parsing is separated from model object. Fixed XML parsing of certain features like constant species. 

## 0.3.1
Various changes fixing issues #1 and #7. BNG2.pl output is immediately piped out stdout.

## 0.3.2
Updated BNGResult object to be user friendly, updated OrderedDict import to try collections library.

## 0.3.3
`run` command can now run bngmodel objects directly, creates a temporary file to do so. Changing 
a parameter value now correctly changes what's being written (expression vs value). 

## 0.3.4
Small bugfix where XML parsing wasn't returning the parsed objects for pattern objects

## 0.3.5
Small bugfix where BNGResult object was incorrectly referring to "results" attribute. Updated 
required pandas version in requirements.txt to avoid incompatibility issues between numpy>=1.20 and older pandas versions.

## 0.3.6
Small bugfix to ensure the model file is opened with UTF-8 encoding which caused some issues on (some) windows machines. s

## 0.3.7
Removing numpy dependency from setup.py, action reading off of BNGL file. 

## 0.3.8
Moving imports around, removing unnecessary ones to speed up CLI performance. 

## 0.3.9
A couple bugfixes to plotting, running the CLI on a model can now generate a log file with the option
-l/--log. Failing to run now raises a ValueError (will be changed with custom errors in the future). Added some input and output file checks to notebook subcommand. 

## 0.4.0 
Fixed a but where "0" species was being printed as "0()". Action block is now a list and not a dictionary which was disallowing multiple actions of the same type. 

## 0.4.1
Changed `bionetgen.run` behavior when called with a `bngmodel` object. Now the model file is saved and if it exists, it's overwritten with a warning. Slightly better error reporting when the `run` call fails. 

## 0.4.2
Changed `bionetgen.run` behavior again, how calling the method with an `out` argument doesn't leave you in the output folder when it's done executing and it will return you back to the folder you started with. Bugfix where parsing a model without actions failed. 

## 0.4.3
Bugfix where the libroadrunner simulator object was not handled correctly. 

## 0.4.4
New info subcommand, major updates to test suite, some updates to error reporting. 

## 0.4.5
Early development version of a new visualize subcommand that automatically runs a visualize action on a model and returns the resulting file. New require keyword that quits if the current version is not equal to or greater than the required one. 

## 0.4.6
Minor bugfix for notebook template, numpy requirement removed for issue #11, fixes for issues #15, #16 and partially #21. 

## 0.4.7
Action arguments are now dictionaries, actions like `setModelName` that needs to be used before the model are now parsed correctly, a bug where using a new line with `\` broke parsing is fixed, added observable pattern quantifier parsing and minor change to parsing to allow for observable quantifiers `<` and `<=`, `sample_times` argument parsing fixes and more informative errors if it fails.

## 0.4.8
Added observable quantifier parsing. Fixes to `actions` argument parsing. 

## 0.4.9
Internal BNG version updated to 2.7.0, added visualization type `all` to get all visualization types in one command. 

## 0.5.0
Minor behavior change to visualize where, if output is specified the files won't copy back to the original folder. 

## 0.5.1
Subcommand atomize is added allowing for translation and atomization of SBML models. A simple test case for flat and atomized translations is added. See `bionetgen atomize -h` for more information. 

## 0.5.2
Various updates and bugfixes for atomize subcommand

## 0.5.3
Bugfix to fixed species output where the `$` appeared before overall pattern compartments, added `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` for the species block to allow for array indexing of seed species. 

## 0.5.4
Default log level for atomizer is now `WARNING`, by default atomizer probes web services now, 
minor atomizer bugfixes

## 0.5.5
Component states in atomizer outputs are now lexically ordered. Minor bugfix for atomizer where a user inputted self-binding site would add two separate binding sites on the same molecule.

## 0.5.6
Fixed an atomizer bug where the export wasn't in UTF-8 encoding. Minor bugfix to CLI plotting where the BNGPlotter import was incorrect and added a CLI plotting test case. 

## 0.5.7
Added parsing support for rule modifiers. Minor bugfix for atomizer. 

## 0.5.8
Added a new subcommand called graphdiff that can calculate differences between two contactmap graphs generated by bionetgen. Minor bugfixes.

## 0.5.9
First working version of the `union` mode for the `graphdiff` subcommand

## 0.6.0
Bugfix for `graphdiff` subcommand, `matrix` mode

## 0.6.1
A new command line argument for `graphdiff`, `--colors` allows you to give a JSON file with keys `g1`, `g2` and `intersect`, each of which are arrays of color hexcodes that determine the colors of the resulting graph.

## 0.6.1.1
Bugfix to `graphdiff` command where not using a color file would break the command. New temporary versioning scheme where very minor fixes like this is added to the last number in the version. E.g. 0.6.1 -> 0.6.1.1 -> 0.6.1.2 etc. This will be continued until 1.0 release. Other small bugfixes and some changes to atomizer. 

## 0.6.2
Updated underlying BioNetGen to version 2.7.1

## 0.6.3
Updated action parsing with a pyparsing grammar. Updated action block testing with new cases.

## 0.7.0
Updated a bug where the `suppress` kwarg to the `bionetgen.run` entrypoint wasn't waiting for the process to terminate before giving the returncode, resulting in runs that looks like they failed.

## 0.7.1
Added support for `energy pattern` and `population map` block after bionetgen 2.7.2 added XML export support for those blocks.

## 0.7.2
Added support for the `Arrhenius` rate law after BioNetGen 2.8.0 added XML support for it. With this, all BioNetGen features
shuold be supported by both BNG-XML exporter from BioNetGen as well as in PyBNG. 


## 0.7.3
Added an experimental parser for `.net` files. Added simulator object that can use the `writeCPYfile` action introduced in [BioNetGen 2.8.2](https://github.com/RuleWorld/bionetgen/releases/tag/BioNetGen-2.8.2), compile the resulting C file and use a wrapper to call C code directly. The C code requires [CVODE 2.6.0](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software), which will also be temporarily distributed with the PyBNG package. GCC is required to compile the C code and the user must set the `cvode_lib` and `cvode_include` configuration options using the [config file system](https://github.com/RuleWorld/PyBioNetGen/blob/main/config/bionetgen.conf.example) which should be named `.bionetgen.conf` and placed under the users home folder. The options should point to CVODE library folder and include folders respectively. 

## 0.7.4
Added a set of custom exceptions and replaced most errors raised with custom exceptions for more descriptive errors. Added proper logging. Added a pattern reader and experimental canonicalization of pattern objects using PyNauty. This feature is not fully functional yet. 

## 0.7.5
Fixed a bug where calling simulators with just the model string was failing. 

## 0.7.6
BNGResult representation didn't have spaces between model names. 

## 0.7.7
Defaults for regulatory visualization are changed. `setup_simulator` now uses `mkdtemp` to avoid issues with Windows temporary file system. 

## 0.7.8
Bugfixes to various parts of cpy simulator code. cpy simulator now tries to identify independent parameters to pass to the c simulator and also returns the time points used for integration. 

## 0.7.9 
Behavior change, now most calls to `BNG2.pl` won't result in verbose output, the default has changed to suppress output. The only call that retains the output is a command line call to the subcommand `run`. Bugfix where the library run function didn't respect suppress option if timeout keyword was used. Bugfix to atomizer where atomization failed if the model only had syn/desyn rules.

## 0.8.0 
Updated underlying BNG and NFsim versions, expanded documentation and preparing for a full release.

## 0.8.1
Updated underlying BNG and NFsim versions.
